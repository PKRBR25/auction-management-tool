## Overview
This document records the development process for implementing the Participant Management functionality in the Auction Management Tool.

## Session Date: June 27, 2025

### Initial Objectives
- Implement participant CRUD operations
- Create participant management UI
- Handle form validation and errors
- Ensure data consistency
- Implement soft delete functionality

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Modified Participant model in Prisma schema
   - Updated phone field from Int to BigInt
   - Added isActive flag for soft delete
   - Created migration for schema changes
   - Added unique constraint on email

2. **API Implementation**
   - Created RESTful endpoints:
     - GET /api/participants (list)
     - POST /api/participants (create)
     - GET /api/participants/[id] (read)
     - PUT /api/participants/[id] (update)
     - DELETE /api/participants/[id] (soft delete)
   - Added input validation with Zod
   - Implemented error handling
   - Added BigInt serialization
   - Added authentication checks

3. **UI Components**
   - Created participant listing page
     - Table view with all participants
     - Action buttons for edit/delete
     - Loading states
   - Implemented creation form
     - Input validation
     - Error messages
     - Success notifications
   - Built edit participant page
     - Pre-filled form data
     - Validation rules
     - Delete functionality
   - Added shared components:
     - Form inputs
     - Toast notifications
     - Switch component
     - Sidebar layout

4. **Form Handling**
   - Implemented React Hook Form
   - Added Zod validation schemas
   - Created consistent phone number handling
   - Added real-time validation
   - Implemented error display
   - Added loading states

5. **Bug Fixes and Improvements**
   - Fixed phone number type mismatch
   - Resolved BigInt serialization issues
   - Fixed form validation types
   - Improved error messages
   - Added consistent button variants
   - Fixed Next.js params handling

### Technical Decisions

1. **Phone Number Handling**
   - Changed from Int to BigInt in database
   - Used string type in forms
   - Added cleaning function to remove non-numeric characters
   - Implemented consistent validation across create/edit

2. **Form Validation Strategy**
   - Used Zod for schema validation
   - Kept validation consistent between frontend and API
   - Added detailed error messages
   - Implemented real-time validation

3. **UI/UX Decisions**
   - Added loading states for better feedback
   - Implemented toast notifications
   - Used consistent button styling
   - Added confirmation for delete action

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **BigInt Handling**
   - Challenge: JSON serialization errors with BigInt
   - Solution: Added toString conversion in API responses

2. **Form Types**
   - Challenge: TypeScript errors with form validation
   - Solution: Updated types to match Zod schema

3. **Phone Validation**
   - Challenge: Inconsistent phone number handling
   - Solution: Standardized approach using string input and cleaning

4. **Next.js Params**
   - Challenge: Params Promise type in Next.js 14
   - Solution: Updated to use proper typing and handling

### Testing Considerations
- Verified CRUD operations
- Tested form validation
- Checked error handling
- Validated soft delete functionality
- Tested phone number handling
- Verified API responses

### Next Steps
- Move to Phase 5: Auction Core implementation
- Consider adding search/filter to participant list
- Plan for pagination if needed
- Consider adding bulk operations
- Plan for participant data export feature
